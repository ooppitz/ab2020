This is a representation of how an online shop could look like in Java.

Some simple features of an online shop are already implemented, more could be coming later on.
These integrated features are still fairly simple, but fairly robust already.

The following are the classes which are implemented, and what they represent

+ Shop: an online shop

+ Customer
+ Purchase
